                        efficient manner. We want every customer to be 100% satisfied, so we will work with any customer who has any
                        questions or concerns about their filings. Our customer service team is made up of dedicated trademark
                        representatives with one goal - to meet each client’s needs in a friendly, caring, and efficient manner. If
                        you do not think we have met this goal, let us know, and we will be happy to make every effort to resolve
                        the issues to your satisfaction. If we don’t, please request a refund of the fees you paid to Trademark
                        Nova. You can send us an email at <a href="mailto:sales@trademarknova.com">sales@trademarknova.com</a> or call us toll-free at 1
                        <a href="tel:(346) 712-7805">(346) 712-7805</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>If we make an error in your filing, we will do our best to admit it and make the changes needed to fix the
                        correction as soon as we can at no additional cost to you. </p>
                     <p>Please note only Trademark Nova fees are refundable; all government fees involved in your filing services
                        are non-refundable. The USPTO may experience delays or deny your application without any fault of the
                        Trademark Nova. These issues are out of our control and will not be the basis for a refund. </p>
                     <p>If you decide that you want a refund, all such requests must be submitted within 30 days of purchase. Your
                        refund will be issued in the same form that it was received. For example, if the payment to Trademark
                        Nova, LLC was made by credit card, then the refund will be issued to the same credit card used to make the
                        payment. However, if you choose, you may request to receive a credit for future Trademark Nova, LLC
                        purchases/payments instead of a refund. All orders will expire six months from order date if we are not in
                        active engagement with you at the one-year anniversary from your date of purchase and you will lose any
                        rights to refunds or additional services at that time. If we are unable to file your order for any reason,
                        outside of any error or mistake on our part, we reserve the right to keep a processing fee. Our obligation
                        ceases when we file documents with the appropriate government agencies, and we are not responsible for
                        delays from the agencies where documents are filed. You acknowledge that we are out of pocket time and money
                        for taking your order with the intent to do the work. Abandoned orders will result in liquidated damages
                        equal to the amount paid to us for reimbursement of our commitment to service this order.</p>

                     <h3 class="section-title">Termination and cancellation</h3>
                     <p>(a) Either Trademark Nova or you may terminate your Account. If Trademark Nova terminates your Account, you will be notified by email and an explanation for the termination will be provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to terminate without giving reasons.</p>
                     <p>(b) If Trademark Nova terminates your Account, any current or pending orders or payments on your Account will be cancelled and provision of Services will not commence.</p>
                     <p>(c) Trademark Nova reserves the right to cancel orders or payments without stating reasons, for any reason prior to processing payment or commencing Services provision.</p>
                     <p>(d) If you are purchasing as a consumer and not as a business, you have the right to cancel your order for the Services within a statutory 7 working day cooling-off period. This period begins when you receive written confirmation of your order from Trademark Nova. If the provision of the Services commences within the cooling-off period, your right to cancel under this provision shall end.</p>
                     <p>(e) If orders or payments are cancelled for any reason prior to commencement of Services provision you will be refunded any monies paid in relation to those purchases.</p>
