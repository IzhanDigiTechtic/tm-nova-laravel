                            <h4>Based on a National Trademark Registration or EU Trademark</h4>
                            <p>Before filing an international application, it's important to have a basis which can be a national trademark registration or an EU trademark, or an application for either of those. If you already have a UK trademark or have filed an application for it, you can extend it to other countries under the Madrid System, which is called an international application. </p>
                            <div class="callout-info">
                                <p class="m-0">If you have a national trademark registration or an application in another country that is a member of the Madrid System, we can help you extend it via the relevant authority. The details in your national trademark registration and your international application must match. You're not required to apply for international trademark registration for all goods and services covered by your national registration, but you can only register the same or fewer goods and services.</p>

                            <h4>Online Filing</h4>
                            <p>To file an international application based on your local trademark registration or application, you must submit it online through UKIPO and specify which countries you want your trademark to cover, with over 90 countries to choose from. After checking for compliance and matching with your local application, UKIPO forwards the application to WIPO. Due to Brexit, EU trademarks and international applications involving the EU are subject to measures to protect existing rights, including automatic conversion of registered trademarks and the ability to file UK applications within nine months after the transition period with the retained priority date. More information is available on the websites of EUIPO and UKIPO.</p>
                            <div class="callout-info">
                                <p class="m-0">If you file the international application within six months of applying for the UK trademark registration, you can claim priority for it. This provides the advantage of starting trademark protection on the same date in all countries covered by the application. You can claim priority for almost every country in the world that is a member of the Treaty of Paris or the World Trade Organization.</p>

                            <p>World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) reviews your application to ensure that it satisfies the necessary conditions, such as clearly describing the goods and services and having paid the required fees. Once all formalities are met, your application is registered in the international trademarks database and published in the WIPO Gazette of International Marks. WIPO then notifies the appropriate authorities in the countries where you've submitted your application. These authorities will then review your application on their own.</p>

It is best to use the services of an IP professional for any communications with the authorities in the relevant countries.
