                     </ul>
                     <p>You may choose not to provide some of the personal information described above. Please note, however, that many of our services require some personal information to operate, so if you choose not to provide the personal information necessary to operate and provide you with a particular service or feature of that service, you may not be able to use that service or feature.</p>
                     <p>We do not proactively collect sensitive personal information, such as health-related information, political opinions, religious beliefs, or genetic data.</p>
                     <h3 class="section-title">Collection of Personal Information</h3>
                     <p>We collect Personal Information you voluntarily submit to us through the Website. It is optional for you to utilize this Website. If you elect to utilize certain aspects of this Website, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), company name, email address, telephone number, and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. If you do not provide certain mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>
                     <p>We may offer contests, sweepstakes or other contests that will require you to sign up and provide additional Personal Information. In that case, we will collect the information provided along with your involvement in such activity. Additionally, we reserve the right to collect any other information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, feedback, or forums on the Website.</p>
                     <p>We may, but are in no way obligated to, provide for referral or “tell another” programs that allow you to recommend the site or an article to a friend. If you choose to do so, we will ask for your referral’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend one or more communications with either the product you have purchased or an invitation for him or her to visit the Website. The communication will allow the referral to unsubscribe from further communications. We will collect this information for the sole purpose of sending an invitation to visit the site, sending their product and tracking the success of any referral program. We will also collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email address to your referral. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you about the status of your referral.</p>
                     <h3 class="section-title">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
                     <p>Cookies are small pieces of data contained in text files, which are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.</p>
                     <p>First Party Cookies. Trademark Nova utilizes cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to allow Website to "personalize" itself for each user by remembering information about the user's visit to the website. For instance, by using the cookies generated by Trademark Nova (“First Party Cookies”) your information is retained so you do not have to continually log back into your account each time you move to a different page. First Party Cookies remain associated with you. However, no third party may use the information we collect through our First Party Cookies for their own purposes. Deletion of these cookies may result in limited functionality of the Website and associated services.</p>
                     <h3 class="section-title">Storage and Protection of Your Information</h3>
                     <p>Your Personal Information may be processed and stored outside of your jurisdiction where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country or state. Your Personal Information will not, however, be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent or which are not permitted under applicable law.</p>
                     <p>Storage of Credit Card Information - When your credit or debit card account information is being transmitted through our Website, it will be protected by security protocols. Trademark Nova does not itself store your credit card or debit card account information, and we do not have direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account information. We may continue to have access to your credit card information through third party services for easy access in the event you decide to order more services from Trademark Nova. We do not otherwise store your credit card information ourselves.</p>
