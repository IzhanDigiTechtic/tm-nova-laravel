                            <h3>Advice to Partners </h3>
                            <p class="mb-3">At Trademark Nova, we have an excellent reputation for advising partners and LLP members on their regulatory obligations, joining a firm, exiting from a firm and disputes. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">We are also able to advise individuals who are being admitted to a partnership or an LLP by reviewing the documentation prior to their admission. We also regularly act for teams of partners leaving one firm to join a competitor. Our partnership agreement solicitors have extensive experience with advising partners and we will work hard to find a solution to your partnership issue.</p>

                            <h3>Partner Disputes </h3>
                            <p class="mb-3">Our partnership and LLP team includes litigation and arbitration lawyers who are highly experienced in financial services litigation and in arbitration in the partnership and LLP field. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">If possible, we aim to resolve partnership disputes without the need for legal action. This is done through negotiation or the use of mediation to resolve matters. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">When an amicable resolution is not available, we have a wealth of experience representing partnerships and LLPs in resolving disputes. Our experience includes arbitrations, injunctions and mediations involving partnerships and LLPs. As a result, we can guide Partners and LLP members towards a resolution of conflicts with pragmatic and cost-effective advice.</p>

                            <h3>Partner Exits </h3>
                            <p class="mb-3">We are focused on providing our clients with a road map through what may often be a stressful and potentially damaging exercise for the firm in exiting one or more of its partners. We focus not only on the legal issues but also on the tactical and commercial handling appropriate to the particular matter.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Many of the partner exits which we advise on include cross-border aspects and also frequently involve conflicting professional conduct and Bar ethics rules. Our partnership and LLP solicitors regularly work with overseas lawyers who are experts in these areas in their local jurisdiction.</p>
