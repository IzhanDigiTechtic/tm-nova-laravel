                            <h3>Who Should File a Statement of Use </h3>
                            <p>Trademark applicants who originally filed an Intent to Use trademark application before they started using their mark in commerce are required to file a Statement of Use. This filing indicates that an applicant has begun using the applied-for trademark in commerce. This enables your respective IPO to register the trademark while you are focusing on strategizing your business.</p>
                            <h3>The Notice Of Allowance </h3>
                            <p>If you need to file a Statement of Use, the IPO will send you a Notice of Allowance (NOA). If you receive an NOA, it usually means that your trademark has passed nearly all the steps in the registration process and is almost ready to be registered. All that remains is proving that your mark is actually being used in commerce.</p>
                            <h3>When to File a Statement of Use</h3>
                            <p>A trademark statement of use is a legal document that must be filed with your respective IPO when a trademark applicant intends to use a particular mark in commerce. Generally, the statement of use must be filed within six months after the IPO issues a Notice of Allowance. This notice indicates that the applicant's trademark has been approved for registration, but the applicant must provide proof of use in commerce to complete the registration process. Therefore, it is important to file a trademark statement of use when the applicant has started using the mark in commerce or is about to start using it. Failing to file the statement of use in a timely manner can result in the cancellation of the trademark application or registration.</p>
                            <h3>What Happens After You File a Statement of Use?</h3>
                            <p>After filing a statement of use for a trademark, the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) will review the submission to ensure that it complies with all relevant requirements. If the statement of use is accepted, the trademark will proceed to registration, and the applicant will receive a registration certificate. However, if the IPO finds any issues with the statement of use, it may issue an office action detailing the problems and requesting a response from the applicant. The applicant will then have a set amount of time to address the issues and respond to the office action. Once the statement of use is accepted and the trademark is registered, the owner of the trademark will have the exclusive right to use the mark in connection with the goods or services identified in the registration. The registration also serves as public notice of the owner's claim of ownership over the trademark, making it easier to enforce against infringing parties.</p>
