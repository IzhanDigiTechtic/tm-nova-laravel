                <h3 class="w-100">Why do companies offer shares?</h3>
                <p>There are several reasons why a company might choose to issue shares:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <ul class="listStyle mt-4">
                        <li>
                            <p>Capital raising: One of the primary reasons companies issue shares is to raise capital. By selling shares of stock, companies can raise funds without taking on debt, which can help improve their financial position.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Liquidity: Issuing shares can provide companies with a source of ongoing liquidity. Once the shares are listed on a stock exchange, investors can buy and sell them as they see fit, which can help increase the value and liquidity of the shares over time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Diversification: Issuing shares can help companies diversify their sources of funding. By raising capital from a diverse range of investors, companies can reduce their reliance on any one source of capital and mitigate risk.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Brand recognition: Issuing shares can help raise a company's profile and increase brand recognition. A successful issuance of shares can generate positive publicity and attract new customers and investors.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Employee incentives: Issuing shares can be used as a way to incentivize employees. By offering stock options or other equity-based compensation, companies can align the interests of their employees with the long-term success of the company.</p>
                        </li>
