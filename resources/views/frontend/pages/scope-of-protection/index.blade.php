                        <p>A trademark is associated with specific goods or services that are sold using that trademark. To register a word, phrase, symbol, or design as a trademark, you must identify the specific goods or services it is used for. A trademark can be used for multiple goods or services. It is important to correctly identify whether you have goods or services when registering a trademark. If customers purchase physical products that bear your trademark, then you have goods, but if they hire you to perform an activity, then you have services. </p> <p>However, if the trademark owner can demonstrate that the similar trademark being used by others is likely to cause confusion among consumers and dilute the distinctiveness of their trademark, they may be able to prevent its use. Trademark owners can also prevent others from using their trademark in a manner that is likely to tarnish its reputation or bring it into disrepute. Overall, the scope of trademark protection is determined by the specific goods or services associated with the trademark, as well as the likelihood of consumer confusion and damage to the trademark's reputation. By being specific about the goods or services associated with your trademark, you can legally prevent others from using a similar trademark for related goods or services without your permission. It is important to accurately identify your goods or services when applying for a trademark, and applying for more goods or services than you use or intend to use may result in your application being denied.</p>
