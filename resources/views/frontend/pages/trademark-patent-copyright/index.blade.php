                        <h4 class="section-title">Trademark</h4>
                        <p>A trademark is a symbol, word, or phrase that identifies the source of a product or service. It distinguishes the products or services of one business from another. Trademarks provide legal protection and help prevent counterfeiting or infringement. Registering a trademark is not mandatory, but it offers additional protection and nationwide rights. The trademark symbol, "TM," can be used even without registration, while the R symbol in a circle can be used after the trademark is registered with your respective IPO.</p>
<h4 class="section-title">Patent</h4>
                        <p>A patent is a form of intellectual property that protects an invention or discovery from being made, used, or sold by anyone else without the inventor's permission. A patent gives the owner exclusive rights to make, use, and sell the invention for a limited period, usually 20 years from the filing date. Patent protection applies to inventions that are novel, non-obvious, and useful. Applying for a patent involves a detailed application process and requires an understanding of patent law.</p>
                    <h4 class="section-title">Copyright</h4>
                        <p>Copyright protects original works of authorship, including literary, musical, artistic, and other creative works. Copyright law grants exclusive rights to the creator or owner of a work, including the right to reproduce, distribute, and display the work. Copyright protection is automatic upon creation of the work and lasts for the life of the author plus a certain number of years. Registering a copyright is not mandatory, but it provides additional legal protections and allows for statutory damages and attorney fees in case of infringement. Copyright does not protect ideas, facts, or methods, only the specific expression of those ideas.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-title">Trademark or Brand</h3>
                        <p>In marketing, a brand refers to how customers perceive a product or service based on factors such as reputation, image, and emotion. For instance, a brand may be designed to evoke feelings of confidence, calmness, or security. In contrast, a federal trademark registration offers legal protection for a brand on a national level for specific goods or services. The decision to protect a brand under trademark law is optional. Business owners typically register their brand names for their primary goods or services and may also choose to register a slogan or logo. However, the extent to which a brand is protected is ultimately determined by the owner. While it's possible to have a brand without trademark protection, failure to register a trademark can leave a brand vulnerable to misuse or infringement by others, potentially leading to confusion among customers and lost sales.</p>
