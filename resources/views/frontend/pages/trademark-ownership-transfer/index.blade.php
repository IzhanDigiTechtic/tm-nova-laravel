                                <p>A well-drafted IP contract is vital when transferring ownership. You want to ensure that terms relating to all aspects of the trade mark and its resemblance are covered and that both the benefits and the liabilities that could arise in the future are clearly agreed upon.</p>
                                <p>Youâ€™ll also want to confirm the legal formalities surrounding a successful transfer and the trade mark itself:</p>
                                <ul class="listStyle mb-4">
                                    <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Is the trade mark registered in the class you wish to use?</li>

                                    <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Is that which is being transferred agreed upon (for example, is it a partial assignment or complete assignment of the rights)?</li>

                                <p>More to consider than you first thought, right? The complexity of issues like legal ownership changes of intellectual property rights usually requires a specialist lawyer to consult throughout the process, plus draft and review documents, contracts and more. After all, you donâ€™t want to get something wrong, or not account for a particular situation, and then run the risk of a costly dispute in the future.</p>
