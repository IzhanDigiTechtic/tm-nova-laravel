This certificate may be required by banks when opening a company bank account or by foreign countries when registering as a foreign corporation.</p>

                            <p>Certificates of Good Standing are most commonly required by companies who are conducting business abroad (outside of the United Kingdom) or are looking to do so.</p>
                            <p>The Certificate will often be requested by various third parties as part of the due diligence process to prove the companyâ€™s existence and standing. This helps when you open a bank account or try to obtain finance. By keeping your company in good standing you protect the directors from any personal liability for actions of the company.</p>
